Hello! I’m Marlon Gracietti de Amorim, a Senior Cloud Engineer and Software Architect with over 15 years of experience in the technology industry. I’m based in Santa Catarina, Brazil.

My expertise lies in designing, modernizing, and migrating cloud-based solutions, primarily focusing on AWS and Azure platforms. I specialize in automating and optimizing cloud infrastructure using tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, always aiming to deliver scalable, secure, and efficient solutions.

I’m passionate about solving complex challenges and have a proven track record of transforming simple proposals into robust, coded, and thoroughly tested solutions. My experience spans a wide range of technologies, from system programming languages to DevOps practices, which allows me to integrate security and performance into every project I work on.

Outside of my technical work, I am dedicated to mentoring and collaborating with other developers. I believe in the power of teamwork and clear communication to drive innovation and continuous improvement. Whether through leading projects or contributing to community events, I am always eager to share knowledge and help others find the simplest, most effective approach to any problem.

When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, listening to music, and exploring new technologies over a cold beer.
